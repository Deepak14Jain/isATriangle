# Triangle Classification Program
 
This repository contains a Java program that classifies triangles based on their side lengths, along with comprehensive test cases to ensure code quality and functionality.
 
## 🧪 Testing
 
The test suite thoroughly covers the following:
 
### ✅ Triangle Classification:

- Equilateral triangles

- Isosceles triangles (all possible arrangements)

- Scalene triangles

- Invalid triangles (e.g., violating the triangle inequality theorem)
 
### 🧾 Input Handling:

- Valid inputs

- Negative values

- Non-integer inputs

- Multiple error conditions (e.g., empty input, letters, special characters)

## 📊 Code Coverage
 
The project has a **high code coverage rate** using JUnit testing.  
After running the tests, a detailed coverage report is generated at:

`/coverage-report/index.html`
 
## Features
 
- Interactive console input for triangle sides

- Input validation with error handling

- Color-coded output for better visualization

- Comprehensive test suite with high code coverage
 
## Requirements
 
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

- JUnit 4 for running tests

- npm (if using the provided npm scripts)
 
## How to Run
 
### Running the Application
 
```bash

npm run startApp -s
```
 
```bash

npm run tests
```

This command executes the JUnit tests and displays the generated report.

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
 
The Triangle classification program implements:

- ✔ Triangle Inequality Theorem validation (`a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, `b + c > a`)

- 🔁 Recursive error handling for invalid user inputs

- 🎨 Color-coded console output for improved readability:

  - **Red** for errors or invalid triangles

  - **Green** for valid triangle types
